This is one of my first webscraping projects.

To search a frequency search a airport ICAO code for example:
  KMSP - minneapolis st. pual intl
  KSEA - seattle international airport
  JFK - JFK airport

to find your local airport icao code search up:  [airport] icao code. for example 
  "tampa bay intl icao code"


the only dependencies needed are beutifulsoup4 and rich
